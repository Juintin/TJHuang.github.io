Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in AI Cluster at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), the
Netherlands, under the supervision of [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/).  I obtained my Ph.D. at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), the Netherlands, under the supervision of Mykola Pechenizkiy, Vlado Menkovski, and Yulong Pei. 

<span style='color:red'> I'm on the job market and looking for full-time research positions.

# Research
My research interests lie in Trustworthy AI,  Adversarial Robustness, Adversarial Attacks, Graph Neural Networks, and Efficient AI.
